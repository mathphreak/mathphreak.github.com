This is a Node.js package I contributed two patches to while I was working on Relief Valve. One was accepting an option to reduce stdout spam. The other was detecting Wine and patching .exe files through Wine if needed.

The second patch wasn't merged, and the upstream author didn't say anything about it, but the pull request is still active if someone else needs it.
