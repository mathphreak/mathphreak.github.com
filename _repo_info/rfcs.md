I discovered while writing csgo-scoreline-monitor that I wanted [a simple feature](https://github.com/mathphreak/rfcs/blob/master/text/0000-ipaddr-common-methods.md) added to Rust. The Rust contributor guidelines aren't quite clear on whether it needed an RFC or not, but the devs themselves are: it did not.
