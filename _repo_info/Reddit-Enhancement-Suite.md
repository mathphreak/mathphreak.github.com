I wrote a [patch](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/pull/826) adding Dogecoin tip support to RES, which already had Bitcoin tip support. That patch was rejected because the RES devs were already planning on replacing their Bitcoin tip support with more generic tipping support.
