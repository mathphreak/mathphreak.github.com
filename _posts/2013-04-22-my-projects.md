I'm going to be looking for a job this summer, and so I've been looking at my resume.

It's atrocious.  I haven't finished much.

But I've started a lot.

I've:

 * Programmed two-player Pong on my calculator
 * Built things with Swing that would have been better done in JS just because I didn't know JS yet
 * Tried to build multiplayer HTML5 games using Canvas and PHP/MySQL
 * Built more than my fair share of non-functional Android apps (with a few functional ones thrown in)
 * Built plenty of Bukkit (Minecraft server) mods only to discover that Bukkit's plugin hosting
   requires you to be 18 to use it `:(`
 * Tried to build a Minecraft Classic server in node.js, only to find that the compressed level
   data packet has no useful documentation
 * Built some things in Meteor
 * Built a quasi-working DCPU-16 emulator in node.js
 * Started trying to port my school's iOS app to Android

Those things all sound useless, or at least impractical, but from each of those things I learned:

 * How to use TI-BASIC, which I still use today, and how to write good programs in a bad language
 * How to build everything in Swing, no matter whether or not it should be built in Swing
 * How easy Canvas is to use, and how hard PHP and MySQL are to use
 * How to write theoretically useful Android apps that don't work (and also ones that do, but
   I'm not as good at that so far)
 * How to write things in Java that make use of a plugin API
 * How to use CoffeeScript and node.js
 * How awesome Meteor is `:D`, and how to do screenscraping to reformat an ugly website into a
   beautiful one, and how to use regexes without going permanently insane (useful skill to have, don't
   you think?)
 * How CPUs work, and how to write unit tests for an emulator, and how to use continuous integration
 * How to use JSON API endpoints from Android

I was making good progress on those, but here's the current status of all of them:

 * Lost the calculator
 * Completely lost interest
 * Ran out of steam and just gave up
 * Hit a difficult spot and kept avoiding the project
 * Java ZIP library backfired and erased my Eclipse workspace so I don't have many of them `:(`
 * Gave up at the level data packet
 * Kept procrastinating finishing things
 * Tried to figure out how to do keyboard input, then ragequit
 * I can't figure out how to use the Android builtin calendar API, so I gave up

I'm more talented than I appear.  Despite what my track record demonstrates, I *am* capable of finishing things.

If you'd like to provide temporary employment to a 16-year-old with no formal work experience, email
the obvious choice @gmail.com and I can get back to you.
