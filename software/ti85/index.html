<p>Well, this was useless.  I was going to type up my programs and then let other people read/download them so they could transfer them.  I got interrupted in the middle, and I've never had a chance to get back to it since.  And I mean, the TI-85 was discontinued in 1997, so why the heck would people who aren't me have one?</p>
