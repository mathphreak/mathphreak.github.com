Hi!
===
I'm mathphreak, otherwise known as Matt H.  I make cool stuff (well, I *start* cool stuff; finishing is overrated).
Sometimes I write [things](/posts.html), but not very often.

stuff I've made
---------------
As I was writing this section, I scrolled down my GitHub repository list, and I thought "that's crap, that's crap,
I never even went anywhere with that...dang I feel special right now."  So I changed my mind, and I'll skip this
section for now.  If you're really curious, you can check out my [github](http://github.com/mathphreak).  Technically,
I make [music](http://mathphreak.bandcamp.com) sometimes too, but it's been a while.
I listen to way more music than I write.  By a factor of approximately aleph-one.

stuff I started but never finished so it doesn't count as being "made" but was still my responsibility

### [this website](https://github.com/mathphreak/mathphreak.github.com)
This is by far the coolest (and most finished) thing I've done.  Ever.  `:(`

### [Zrczr](https://github.com/mathphreak/Zrczr)
I had an idea a while back to make a game with HTML5 Canvas.  I didn't get very far before I lost interest and moved on
to something else.  I should probably go look at that again, as it sounds way more feasible now.
