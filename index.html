<p>Hi.  I'm Matt.  I write stuff for the computer.  My current project is <a href="/VCRI/">VCRI</a>, a Google Chrome extension that builds on <a href="http://canvasrider.com">Canvas Rider</a>.</p>
<p>I've worked on quite a few projects besides VCRI, most of which have been written in Java.  I like Java from a platform independence perspective, and I like Web development for the same reason.  Not that anyone really cares.</p>
<p>I have nothing left to say right now.  Thank goodness for that.</p><br />
<p>I also have a <a href="http://juniorgeek.users.sourceforge.net">similar (but much less frequently updated) page on SourceForge</a>.</p>
