<h1>STUFF IS BEING FIXED</h1>
<h2>come back in a day or two</h2>
<!--<p>Hi.  I'm Matt.  I write stuff that runs on almost any computing platform (but I don't guarantee it'll work the first time).  My current project is <a href="http://meta-tourney.sf.net">Meta Tourney</a>, a JavaScript-based tournament manager.</p>
<p>I've worked on quite a few projects besides Meta Tourney, most of which have been written in Java or JavaScript.  I like Java from a platform independence perspective, and I like Web development for the same reason.  And the ironic thing is that I don't drink coffee.</p>
<p>Most of my projects that I've worked on over the years are on the sidebar at left.  If you want to see the un-presentable projects, find them yourself.</p><br />
<p>I also have a <a href="http://juniorgeek.users.sourceforge.net">much worse and much older page on SourceForge</a>.</p>-->
