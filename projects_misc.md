# Misc. Projects

## Grade Migration Helper
This was a Java utility I built while working at my high school. It takes in CSV data and outputs slightly altered CSV data: different column names, reordered columns, differently presented dates. I added a Swing UI to make it more user-friendly since it didn't seem feasible to fully automate the process. It was fairly specialized for the particular situation we needed it for, so I didn't publish it.
