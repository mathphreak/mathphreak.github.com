<p>mathphreak does music, too.</p>
<p>I have this really great idea for what happens once I make eight or ten tracks.  I put them all on an album and call the album "Greatest Hits Volume 1".  Then I make more and call the next album "Greatest Hits Volume 2", etc.</p>
<p>Brilliant album titles notwithstanding, I've got myself some pretty good stuff.  You can see what I have planned for each album once I get there below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/music/vol1/">Greatest Hits Volume 1</a></li>
</ul>
